### TODOs

- [ ] Complete the terms identified with a TODO - around 30+ of them.
- [ ] Add the other terms if they are missing from [this link](https://www.inboundlogistics.com/articles/warehousing-process), warehouse/reailing related term in [Gartner glossary](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary), [Softeon glossary](https://www.softeon.com/glossary/) and [IBM WMS Glossary](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/warehouse-management/9.5.0?topic=glossary)

### Terminology

**Advance Shipping Notification (ASN)**: It is an electronic data interchange (EDI) message sent from the shipper to the receiver prior to the departure of the shipment from the shipper’s facility. The message includes complete information about the shipment and its contents. In today’s environment, this message is more often an “as shipped notice” sent after the departure of the shipment.After receiving an order and preparing a shipment, the sellers or shippers then need to let the buyer, such as a retailer or distributor, know the details for the shipment they are about to receive. This helps the buyer to plan ahead for incoming shipments, reconcile EDI 856 detail with incoming inventory, and automate receiving workflows. For more info refer to [this link](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/asn-advanced-shipment-notice "EDI856 is an imortant & frequently used transaction among suppliers, distributors, manufacturers and retailers")

**Areas in a Warehouse**: Warehouse areas refer to the specific zones reserved for particular activities such as receiving, storage, order picking and shipping, among others. Each area has a special purpose and is designed to facilitate the flow of materials and products within the facility. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.mecalux.com/blog/warehouse-areas). There are usually _five areas_ in a warehouse which are the following:

1. _Docks and loading/unloading area_: where materials enter and leave on trucks or other goods transport vehicles.
1. _Receiving and staging area_: It is the entry point for materials arriving at the facility. In this area, the receiving process takes place, which includes tasks such as quality control, inventory recording and product inspection.
1. _Storage area_: This is the heart of the logistics centre. Here, goods are housed and organised once they’ve been received and checked. The warehouse storage area should facilitate fast and efficient access to materials, leveraging available space and minimising the time and effort involved in locating and handling SKUs.
1. _Picking area_: In the picking zone, warehouse operators retrieve the merchandise they need to fill customers’ orders. This space can be integrated with the storage area, as in the case of picking from pallets. Picking areas can also be set up in specific zones within the facility, normally with automated or semi-automated systems.
1. _Shipping area_: In the shipping or goods dispatch zone, orders are prepared and sent to their final destination. Although it tends to be near the facility’s exit, the positioning of the shipping area will be influenced by several elements. These include the number of shipments, the volume of routes managed daily, scheduling and even the location of the warehouse in relation to its surroundings (which will limit the number of docks or concentrate them in a specific zone).

**Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS)**: It is a broader term used to refer to any computer-controlled system that stores and retrieves items automatically. ASRS systems use robots and a grid or shelving system to store items in flexible locations within a grid of shelving system. For more info refer to [this link](https://6river.com/what-is-an-automated-storage-and-retrieval-system/ "1. Types of ASRS.

**Batch Picking**: This is one type of Picking operation. Batch picking involves a worker moving through the warehouse collecting goods for several orders at once.

**Automated MHE Interfaces**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Cart Staging**: These are intermediate areas in the picking area where the carts are kept temporarily to be moved to another place. Refer to [this link](https://www.tractonomy.com/kit-carts-to-assembly-lines/) on Autonomous Towing Robots (ATRs) help in moving the carts between the picking/staging area and the shipping area.

**Channel Management**: TODO

**Cross-docking**: Cross-docking is a logistics technique that aims to accelerate goods delivery and increase supply chain efficiency. It involves unloading goods from vehicles making incoming shipments at a logistics facility and transferring them to vehicles handling outgoing shipments, requiring little or no storage time in between. Companies take advantage of cross-docking to consolidate products from multiple suppliers, break down bulk shipments into smaller lots and reorganize items for efficient delivery to retail stores, fulfillment centers and customers. Cross-docking requires close coordination among a company’s supply chain partners, including its suppliers and freight carriers. This is an optional warehouse operation. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/cross-docking.shtml).

**Cubic Storage**: TODO (Autostore)

**Cycle Counting**: Cycle counting is a method of inventory control used in warehouses to ensure that physical inventory counts match the recorded inventory. It involves counting a subset of inventory on a regular basis in different areas of the warehouse. This is a warehouse operation. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.cadretech.com/blog/cycle-counting-in-warehousing-best-practices).

For vendors who have automated this process are:

- [Hand Scanners vs. StorTRACK Cycle Count Showdown - Vimaan](https://vimaan.ai/resources/video/cycle-counting-handheld-scanners-vs-stortrack/)
- Using drones for cycle counting of inventory (TODO)

**Directed putaway**: A putaway process in which the WMS determines where a given receipt of goods should be stored in the distribution center. Directed putaway is tightly connected to the concept of “zoning” in which storage locations are grouped together, examples being “fast-movers” or “HAZMAT” products. With directed putaway, companies use a WMS to configure a hierarchical set of rules to identify the best location to store a receipt of inventory. If there is no space available in the preferred zone (e.g., fast-movers), the WMS putaway process would look for the next best available zone (e.g., medium-movers). This is a warehouse operation. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.softeon.com/glossary/directed-putaway/).

**Dock appointment Scheduling**: This is a WMS feature.

**Fulfillment Center (FC)**: Another name for Distribution Center. There are different types depending on their location, size & purpose:

- Out-of-town FC: located outside of town of a larger size
- Micro FC: located within town but of smaller size & for local distribution
- In-store FC: located in a neighborhood and part of a store or the store itself

**Fulfillment Order (FO)**: It is an information object which consists of products that are part of a customer order.

**Goods-to-Person (G2P or GTP)**: Goods-to-Person (GTP) is a warehouse automation solution in which products are brought to a person by a fixed or Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs).

For more info refer to [this link](https://www.dropoff.com/blog/micro-fulfillment/)

**Multicarrier Parcel Management**: TODO

**Multicarrier Shipping**: At its core, multi-carrier shipping is a B2B logistics operation that involves utilizing multiple carriers to deliver packages. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows businesses to compare rates, transit times, and routes, optimizing the selection of carriers based on specific package requirements. Multi-carrier shipping solutions, such as those offered by ClickPost and Aftership, use advanced technologies like AI-driven engines and API integrations to streamline the order creation, tracking, and management processes. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.dropoff.com/blog/multi-carrier-shipping/).

**Packing**: The act of packing a fulfillment order with the products in that order. This is a WMS feature.

**Person-to-Goods (P2G or PTG)**: As the name suggests, Person-to-Goods picking involves workers traveling the aisles of a warehouse or retail facility to manually select items for an order and then bringing them to an area for packing. Today, many Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) solutions on the market are based on Person-to-Goods fulfillment and operate as smart carts powered by software. The order picker meets the robot at the pick site, removes items from the shelf, puts them into the smart cart, then each proceeds separately to another pick location. People walk less because they tend to concentrate on a warehouse zone, say an aisle or two, which means less foot travel. The smart carts handle most of the travel including the longer return route to the packing station when all items in the order have been picked.

**Picker**: It is a person who does the picking of items to be packed.

**Pick-to-Light System**: Pick to light is a type of order-fulfillment technology designed to improve picking accuracy and efficiency, while simultaneously lowering your labor costs. Notably, pick to light is paperless; it employs alphanumeric displays and buttons at storage locations, to guide your employees in light-aided manual picking, putting, sorting, and assembling.

This is a warehouse operation.

**Picking and Packing**: . This is a WMS feature. TODO

**Putaway**: TODO

**Put-to-Light System**: Often referred to as “pick-to-light in reverse,” a put-to-light system uses light modules that direct operators to the correct location to sort, or “put,” items into. (As opposed to a pick-to-light system, where lights direct operators to stock keeping unit/SKU locations to select, or “pick,” items.)

**Receiving**: It is the process of handling inbound inventory into a warehouse. This is a Warehouse operation. The warehouse receiving process involves several steps, including:

- Pre-arrival preparation: Confirm deliveries with suppliers and establish communication channels

- Control flow of inventory into the warehouse
- Track the location of inventory within the warehouse
- Control flow of inventory within the warehouse for picking & packing
- Manages the order flows and tasking

**Wave Picking**: With wave picking, orders are grouped and picked in batches, but at specific times of day. Here’s how it works:

- Worker receives a consolidated pick list.
- Worker uses a multi-tote picking cart to manage the various items in a particular wave.
- Worker picks approximately 4 to 12 orders (per wave).

Wave picking is useful for both low-pick and high-pick operations. For low-pick operations, wave picking reduces the number of trips workers take back and forth. For high-pick operations, warehouse managers couple wave picking with zone picking to run the most efficient workflow possible. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.logiwa.com/blog/warehouse-wave-picking).

**Wave Planning/Management**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Yard Management**: Yard management is the act of planning, controlling, organizing, and guiding vehicles, containers, and other methods of transport to the optimal dock or location in the yard of a distribution center or warehouse to efficiently move goods from the warehouse to the point of transportation. When executed properly, it optimizes the flow of vehicles and cargo within the on-premises yard. This is an optional warehouse operation. For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.manh.com/our-insights/resources/articles/what-is-yard-management).

**Yard Management System (YMS)**: Yard Management System, or YMS is a software solution designed to monitor the movement of trailers in the yard and dock of a facility, distribution center, or warehouse. Yard Management Systems can create valuable opportunities for agility and efficiency by filling the visibility gaps in your operations between transportation and warehouse. For more info, refer to this link](https://www.fourkites.com/yard-management-system/).

**Zone Picking**: This is one type of picking operation. Zone picking involves workers dedicated to a specific section passing order totes from one zone to the next.
