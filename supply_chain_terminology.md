### Terminology

**Advance Shipping Notification (ASN)**: It is an electronic data interchange (EDI) message sent from the shipper to the receiver prior to the departure of the shipment from the shipper’s facility. The message includes complete information about the shipment and its contents. In today’s environment, this message is more often an “as shipped notice” sent after the departure of the shipment.After receiving an order and preparing a shipment, the sellers or shippers then need to let the buyer, such as a retailer or distributor, know the details for the shipment they are about to receive. This helps the buyer to plan ahead for incoming shipments, reconcile EDI 856 detail with incoming inventory, and automate receiving workflows. For more info refer to [this link](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/asn-advanced-shipment-notice "EDI856 is an imortant & frequently used transaction among suppliers, distributors, manufacturers and retailers")

**Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS)**: It is a broader term used to refer to any computer-controlled system that stores and retrieves items automatically. ASRS systems use robots and a grid or shelving system to store items in flexible locations within a grid of shelving system. For more info refer to [this link](https://6river.com/what-is-an-automated-storage-and-retrieval-system/ "Types of ASRS.\\n How do they work? \nTheir advantages/disadvantages.\nHow to choose right system?\nHow much do they cost?\nAlternative: AMR") and [this vendor products specific link](https://www.bastiansolutions.com/solutions/technology/asrs)

**Barcode**: Barcode is used to encode data in a format which can be easily scanned by scanner for automation. In a warehouse, it is used to identify things and locations.

**Barcode Symbology**: It refers to the sandards used to encode data in a barcode. There are two main types: 1D and 2D. A short list of the barcode standards are listed below, For more info, refer to [this link](https://www.zebra.com/ap/en/resource-library/faq/what-is-barcode-symbology.html) and [this link](https://www.scandit.com/resources/guides/types-of-barcodes-choosing-the-right-barcode/ "Types of barcodes - choosing the right barcode")

**Automated MHE Interfaces**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Cart Staging**: TODO

**Channel Management**: TODO

**Cross-docking**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Cubic Storage**: TODO (Autostore)

**Cycle Counting**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Dock appointment Scheduling**: This is a WMS feature.

**Fulfillment Center (FC)**: Another name for Distribution Center. There are different types depending on their location, size & purpose:

- Out-of-town FC: located outside of town of a larger size
- Micro FC: located within town but of smaller size & for local distribution
- In-store FC: located in a neighborhood and part of a store or the store itself

**Fulfillment Order (FO)**: It is an information object which consists of products that are part of a customer order.

**Goods-to-Person (G2P or GTP)**: Goods-to-Person (GTP) is a warehouse automation solution in which products are brought to a person by a fixed or Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). Associates receive the items needed to prepare an order at their pick stations without having to move in any meaningful way from their location. (Ref 5 gives more details).

**Inspection for Quality Control**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Inventory Management**: It is the act of managing the product inventory across warehouses and inside a single warehouse. (TODO). This is a WMS feature.

**Labor Management**: TODO (Assume it is allocation of work to pickers & other workers in a warehouse. This is a WMS feature.

- Also known as Workforce Management.

**Light Manufacturing/Kitting**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Location Management**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Material Handling Equipment (MHE)**: TODO

**Micro-fulfillment Center (MFC)**: Micro-fulfillment refers to the process of utilizing small-scale automated fulfillment centers strategically located near urban areas to facilitate rapid order processing and delivery. Equipped with advanced robotics, conveyor systems, and software algorithms, these compact facilities efficiently pick, pack, and dispatch orders in a fraction of the time it takes traditional warehouses. For more info refer to [this link](https://www.dropoff.com/blog/micro-fulfillment/)

**Multicarrier Parcel Management**: TODO

**Order Allocation**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Order Management System**: It is an IT system which manages orders. (TODO)

**Packer**: It is a person who packs the products that are in a specific fulfillment order.

**Parcel manifesting**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Packing**: The act of packing a fulfillment order with the products in that order. This is a WMS feature.

**Person-to-Goods (P2G or PTG)**: As the name suggests, Person-to-Goods picking involves workers traveling the aisles of a warehouse or retail facility to manually select items for an order and then bringing them to an area for packing. Today, many Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) solutions on the market are based on Person-to-Goods fulfillment and operate as smart carts powered by software. The order picker meets the robot at the pick site, removes items from the shelf, puts them into the smart cart, then each proceeds separately to another pick location. People walk less because they tend to concentrate on a warehouse zone, say an aisle or two, which means less foot travel. The smart carts handle most of the travel including the longer return route to the packing station when all items in the order have been picked.

**Picker**: It is a person who does the picking of items to be packed.

**Pick-to-Light System**: Pick to light is a type of order-fulfillment technology designed to improve picking accuracy and efficiency, while simultaneously lowering your labor costs. Notably, pick to light is paperless; it employs alphanumeric displays and buttons at storage locations, to guide your employees in light-aided manual picking, putting, sorting, and assembling.

**Picking**: The act of picking the products required for a fulfillment order n the required quantity. This is a WMS feature.

**Put-to-Light System**: Often referred to as “pick-to-light in reverse,” a put-to-light system uses light modules that direct operators to the correct location to sort, or “put,” items into. (As opposed to a pick-to-light system, where lights direct operators to stock keeping unit/SKU locations to select, or “pick,” items.)

**Receiving**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Replenishment**: Replenishment is a process where stocks stored at non-pickface locations(also referred to as reserved locations or bulk locations) are sent to the pickface locations within the warehouse. A pickface(also referred to as a Forward Location) is a location set up for loose picking. This is a WMS feature.

**Shipping Execution**: It is an IT system which does the following:

- Printing care-compliant label
- Printing of standard bill of lading
- Printing parcel carrier label to put on actual box

**Slotting**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Staging**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Stock locating**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Task Allocation**: It is the function of allocating or assigning tasks to operators and other automation equipments in the warehouse.

**Task Interleaving**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Third Party Logistics (3PL) Billing**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

- Outbound load planning optimization
- Routing

**Truck Loading**: TODO. This is a WMS feature.

**Voice Picking**: TODO (ref. 2 part 4). This is a WMS feature.

**Warehouse**: It is a physical building which stores products in containers & racks. There can many such warehouses in a place from which orders are fulfilled. A warehouse is also called a **Distribution Center**.

**Warehouse Control System (WCS)**: It is an IT system which implements the following functions:

- Manages many types of automated equipment: conveyor, sorters, ASRS, Pick to light, Carrousels, Print & Apply
- Exchanges real-time communications (ms), command processing, discrete equipment signals and the optimisation of material (multiple UOML: units, cartons and pallets)

**Warehouse Execution System (WES)**: It is an IT system which does:

- Optimie and balance how work is performed on automated equipment
- Dynamically allocates orders based upon WCS inputs (machine language)

**Warehouse management System (WMS)**: It is an IT system which implements the following functionality:

- Control flow of inventory into the warehouse
- Track the location of inventory within the warehouse
- Control flow of inventory within the warehouse for picking & packing
- Manages the order flows and tasking
