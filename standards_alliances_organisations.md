## Alliances, Organisations & Initiatives

1. **[GS1 Sunrise 2027 Initiative](https://www.scandit.com/blog/gs1-sunrise-2027-smart-data-capture-revolution/)**: It is an initiative which will lead to the gradual phasing out of UPC and EAN barcodes. They will be replaced by QR codes and Data Matrix codes – a type of 2D barcode that offers more data storage capacity and improved scanning capabilities.
1. **[MHI](https://www.mhi.org/about)**: The nation's largest material handling, logistics and supply chain association, we work to deliver the latest knowledge, the strongest connections, powerful industry leadership, and the best market access for manufacturing and supply chain professionals. Our 975+ members and 18 Industry Groups power research and solution sourcing to drive the innovations you can see at our world-class events.
1. **[The Robotics Group (TRG)](https://www.mhi.org/trg)**: Group of leading manufacturers, integrators, consultants, and component suppliers of robotic solutions designed specifically for warehousing and distribution applications. Traditionally, industrial robots in material handling applications have been limited to palletizing/depalletizing, conveyor picking, or other highly-repetitive tasks. Technology advancements are creating opportunities for robots and automated machinery in a wider variety of applications, including warehousing and distribution center activities.

1. [EPICS and CBV from GS1](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)
- EPCIS is GS1's flagship data sharing standard for enabling visibility, within organisations as well as across an entire supply chain of trading partners and other stakeholders. It helps provide the “what, when, where, why and how” of products and other assets, enabling the capture and sharing of interoperable information about status, location, movement and chain of custody.
- The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a companion standard which provides definitions of data values that may be used to populate the data structures defined in the EPCIS standard.
